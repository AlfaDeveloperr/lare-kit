## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Lare-kit
Our vite-config.js document contains an import like this
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

We give react() outside the plugin

resources/views welcome.blade.php between the head
@viteReactRefresh
@vite(['resources/js/main.jsx'])

with this code we create the main.jsx in the App.jsx components pages architecture App.jsx and render in main.jsx
Home.jsx in the pages folder is our homepage is rendered to us, that is, the first page you see when you run the project In App.css we give style for general css classes but when including the library we give resources/css/app.css and index.css React works in this way and allows us to do UI AND UX programming, so where exactly does Larawel come into play is as follows: It produces an API, thanks to this generated Apikey, React sends a request, Larawel verifies these requests and processes the incoming data in the database, if you are familiar with Larawel, all you need to know is to know React, you should download some packages before running the project
"@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.7",
"react-dom": "^19.1.0",
"react-icons": "^5.5.0",
"react-router": "^7.6.1",
"react-router-dom": "^7.6.1",
"tailwindcss": "^4.1.7"

After all packages are downloaded, go to the project directory and first give the npm run dev command, then give the php artisan serve command, then the application will work, do not forget to configure the .env document, if you wish, connect the database for your backend application with .env and

resources/routes/web.php Thanks to the code at the bottom, the system works with crud logic so that you do not have problems with react-router and
resources/js/boostrap allows http and https protocols such as fetch and axios
thanks to this kit we made
You can write fast applications with Larawel, a backend architecture where UI AND UX web applications can be written. You can make a difference in design thanks to the React JS based UI architecture. I created a kit by bringing the frontend and backend together. You can quickly develop web applications as you wish with a ready-made kit.

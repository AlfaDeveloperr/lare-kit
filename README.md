## What is Lare-Kit?

**Lare-Kit is a modern starter kit that combines the Laravel backend with the React.js frontend using Vite and Tailwind CSS, allowing you to build fast, scalable web applications with clean architecture and excellent developer experience.**

* React handles the UI and UX layer, routing with react-router-dom.

* Laravel supports the backend as a REST API provider with API keys for secure communication.

* Tailwind CSS is pre-configured for styling.

* The setup allows you to write your frontend as a Single Page Application (SPA) while Laravel handles all backend logic and database CRUD operations.

* This kit is ideal for developers who want a ready-to-use full-stack architecture that combines the best of Laravel and React.

# Getting Started Prerequisites
## Make sure you have the following installed:

* PHP >= 8.2.12

* Composer

* Node.js & npm

* MySQL or any other supported database

## Installation Clone the repository:
- [git clone] (https://github.com/AlfaDeveloperr/lare-kit.git)

## To download as an npm package
# npm i lare-kit

## Install frontend dependencies:
# npm install

## Start development servers:
* npm run dev # start Vite + React dev server
* php artisan serve # start Laravel backend server

## Open your browser and visit:
# (http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## Project Structure and Usage
# resources/js/main.jsx â€” React application entry point.

* resources/views/welcome.blade.php â€” Laravel blade view that loads React via Vite.

* React components follow the pages/components structure for scalability.

* Tailwind CSS is included via resources/css/app.css.

* API routes and Laravel backend logic are in routes/api.php and controllers.

* route/web.php uses a wildcard route to serve the React app for all frontend URLs, avoiding conflicts with React Router.

## Route::get('/{any}', function () {
## return view('welcome'); // React root blade
## })->where('any', '.*');
